            <p>As someone re-entering into the Creative Art / Web industry with very minimal support, this call was a big help. It allowed me to gauge my progress, choices, and goals against someone that has already been through this phase.</p>

            <p>Travis provides solid career advice for creatives. I felt I was talking to someone who has walked the same path I'm walking. He is a humble, hard working man, and a great example to follow in this industry. That's the kind of person you want to get advice from.</p>
