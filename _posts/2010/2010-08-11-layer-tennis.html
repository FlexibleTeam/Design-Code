<p class="cuf-avenir">My first inclination, of course, is to use photos of dead presidents. I found this one of Lincoln. I respect him as a great leader and as a &lsquo;hero,&rsquo; but he has one scary mug, so I burnt it off.</p>

<p class="cuf-avenir">I&#8217;ll tell you where our heros have gone, to the freakin moon, spreading democracy while you sleep tight at night wrapped in an American flag. A common misconception in American history is that Lincoln lead the unification, but in reality he was busy beating the cheese out of commie moon-men.</p>

<p class="cuf-avenir">It is a little known historical fact that Lincoln took us into space. It is even more closely guarded secret that the way to fuel a trip into the void of space is to use pure, unrefined Rock n&#8217; Roll. My return in this match was the first space album ever made. The only problem is that: in space no one can hear you shred.</p>
