		<p class="section_lead">Recently there has been a lot of commotion about the typeface Helvetica. In 2007 a very popular film was created to document the 50th anniversary of this prolific face. According to not-a-few accounts this film only served to fan the flame of what may have been a passing resurgence of a fad into an all-out neo-modernist revival in the usage of the face. Who can complain? Helvetica is a gift from the Swiss gods of type design.</p>

		<h3 class="history_h">an abbreviated history</h3>
		<p class="history_p">For those of my readers who are not familiar with the historical significance of Helvetica it will suffice to say that Helvetica was designed in the late 50's to be marketed as a competitor in the Swiss market with the established and popular Akzidenz-Grotesk. Helvetica's popularity in the 50's, 60's and 70's was unmatched as it was adopted internationally for uses in branding, advertising and communications. It was, in a way, a rebuttal to the swashy hand-lettered signs and ads of the era, and in some cases represented a new way of thinking, a breath of fresh air, and a way to get rid of the clutter. These tenants of simplifying and reducing were also held by the Modernists of that time, who adopted Helvetica as what came to be interpreted in some minds as the de-facto typeface of that movement. (Of course Helvetica was not used exclusively, but its prominence can not be denied.) One of the major reasons that Helvetica was so successful in these conditions is that visually, the letter forms were neutral in implied meaning &mdash; as opposed to a script which often implies elegance or formality, or a serif face which can have a scholarly or official implication. Helvetica was intended to be neutral in its visual implications, in fact the very name itself &mdash; Helvetica &mdash; translates to 'Swiss,' a personification of a country who has remained historically neutral in almost all instances.</p>

	<div class="brother_wrap">
		<h3 class="brother_h">the mysterious brother</h3>
		<p class="brother_p">I imagine that most of the people who frequent this blog are at least familiar with the history of Helvetica. What may not be so obvious is the history of the variant Helvetica Neue. If you own a Mac you will have noticed that the default font in many of the applications is Helvetica. If you have played around with the pre-installed fonts you may have come across Helvetica Neue. There are eleven faces included in this family, compared to the four included in the default installation of Helvetica. I hope it can become clear why some choose to use the Neue variant.</p>
		
		<h3 class="what_h">what's neue?</sup></h3>
		<p class="what_p">In 1983, Linotype's daughter company Stempel AG released a reworking of Helvetica with more structurally unified heights and widths. I was delighted to learn that Erik Spiekermann was the design consultant on the project and also created the literature for the launch. This strikes me as ironic since it was Spiekermann who, in the film mentioned above, railed against the face. His major critique  was that Helvetica has become 'ubiquitous' in that it is seen and used everywhere and often with poor taste. Not exactly a criticism of the design of the face itself, but of its use, and often miss-use. Other changes in this newer design include improved legibility, heavier punctuation marks, increased spacing in the numbers and an expanded family of weights, 51 in&nbsp;all.</p>

	<p class="section_lead">For the longest time I used Helvetica and Helvetica Neue interchangeably and really had no preference for either of them. Not too long ago I decided to take a closer look and compare, letter by letter, to discover the difference, and more importantly, if it even mattered. What I found was not life changing to say the least, but interesting enough to write about it on my day off &mdash; Thus!</p>

	<div class="process_wrap">
		<h3 class="process_h">the process used</h3>
		<p class="process_p">In comparing these two fonts made up of shapes nearly identical, there are not many processes that will give an accurate depiction. One cannot, with great success, inspect one and then move their eyes quickly to the other hoping to notice the subtleties of the cuts. I elected to place them one on top of the other, aligned to the center or the stem (whichever appropriate) of the character, using two different colors and a transparency technique to allow a new, third color to appear where the letter forms overlap. In the following studies I have designated Helvetica in a yellow color and Helvetica Neue in cyan. When the two overlap the resulting color is green. I studied both the regular and bold weights, but I am showcasing only the bold as it is more &#8230; substantial in larger sizes.<br /><br />
		In the following I will select the letters I feel showed the biggest departure in the redesign of Helvetica Neue, and for each I will give my opinion about which I like better. Keep in mind please, that I am a self-taught type-lover and these are only my observations &mdash; they may be a bit naive.</p>

	<img style="float:left;" src="/assets/post-assets/002-old-versus-neue/img/neue_bigG.png" />
	<h3 class="g_h">the letter &#8220;G&#8221;</h3>
	<p class="g_p">Showing major different cuts in the letter 'g,' it seems that Helvetica Neue is trying to tighten up things a bit. The first thing that should be obvious is that the height of the lowercase is taken in; both the top and the bottom of the letter show results from this trim. As a result, a bit of definition in the arc of the loop leading up to the terminal is lost. In this instance I prefer the original cut.<br /><br />
	The capital 'G' tells the same story. The arc, or shoulder, is pressed down in comparison to the original Helvetica. It's as if the re-designers were trying to make the letters take up less space. <br /><br />
	As Helvetica is known for being a face that is 'held' by the whitespace in and surrounding it, I wonder why this approach was taken? <br /><br />
	In the case of the 'Gg,' I prefer Helvetica over Helvetica Neue.</p>
	<div class="clear"></div>

	<div class="m_wrap">
		<h3 class="m_h">the letter &#8220;M&#8221;</h3>
		<p class="m_p">In what looks to be a philosophy completely opposite to 'g,' 'm' has been expanded visually. This way of thinking is most noticeable in the capital form. The fillet, or space between the adjoining strokes in the center of the 'M' is not as deep, neither are the cuts on the opposite of these strokes. As a result, the strokes themselves are thickened and the letter form overall is given quite a bit more weight.<br /><br />
		This same idea of strengthening is passed on to the lowercase 'm' by extending the overall width and pressing down on the top to create a more husky shape.<br /><br />
		I had to take a double take when I saw this. In the case of the letter 'Mm' I much prefer Helvetica Neue.</p>

	<img style="float:left;" src="/assets/post-assets/002-old-versus-neue/img/neue_bigR.png" />

	<div class="r_wrap">
		<h3 style="margin-left:0px;" class="r_h">the letter &#8220;R&#8221;</h3>
		<p class="r_p">I noticed this difference before the study, in fact it was the very thing that sparked my interest and led to the study itself. The leg of the capital 'R' has been re-imagined all together, as opposed to the other re-alignments we have heretofore seen. Helvetica has a curve as you go down the leg, then a swift hook before the final terminal. Helvetica Neue throws the hook out the window, and in doing so, the said ark ends in a sharp point at the terminal. Wow. I know, right? This little feature is only seen in one other instance: the lowercase bold 'a.' That letter sees the same change (not pictured.)<br /><br />
		The lowercase 'r' receives the same expansion in width and compression in height as is seen in the other examples. In this instance it feels like the spur is given room to end properly.<br /><br />
		In the case of the 'Rr' I mourn the loss of that hook on the leg, but I prefer the spacing and feel of Helvetica Neue.</p>
	</div><div class="clear"></div>

	<div class="n_wrap">
		<h3 class="n_h">the numbers &ldquo;1&rdquo; and &ldquo;2&rdquo;</h3>
		<p class="n_p">My study not only covered both upper and lowercase in both regular and bold weights, but the numerals of each weight also.<br /><br />
		In this example we can see the same expanded width and compressed height at work. Interesting to note the flag (is that what we are calling that sticky-outy bit?) on the '1' has been lowered, as has been the terminal of the '2.'<br /><br />
		Because of the expansion in the width there is a defined stress on the central stroke of the '2' resulting in a little big more attitude. The flow of that stroke is one of the things that set Helvetica apart from its then competitor, Akzidenz-Grotesk.<br /><br />
		In the case of these numerals I prefer Helvetica Neue.</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:80px;" class="section_lead">I hope that was as fun and enlightening for you to read as it was for me to discover and write. I guess the only thing to do now is to add up the votes. The sample I took here (these four instances) came from reviewing the entire alphabet and selecting the ones with the greatest differences  and the best talking points between them. You can download the sheet I created to conduct my study and review them for yourself. I'd like to know your opinions and preferences in the comments below.</p>

	<div class="win_wrap">
		<h3 class="win_h">and the<br/> winner is&#8230;</h3>
		<p class="win_p">Of course this study only concerns two weights from each family, and is therefore slightly limited in its scope.<sup><a name="note11" href="#notes">11</a></sup><br /> I am not recommending that in all cases this is true for all applications, but for this study, the winner is Helvetica Neue with three out of four votes!</p>
