  <h1>Rootbeer Tasting</h1>
  
  <p class="left-blurb">The careful craft of brewing does not belong to fermented drinks alone. Family recipies, exotic ingredients &amp; regional tastes are all a part of the rootbeer culture, which I adore.</p>
  
  <p class="dive-in">Dive In</p>
  
  <p class="right-blurb">I have always favored rootbeer as my choice frosty beverage. In this article I hand pick ten gormet brews and put them to the test, judging them for head, bite, body and aftertaste. Which is the best?</p>

      		  <h3>Body</h3>
      		  <p>The body has sharp tastes of root beer spices, but is not sweet or very exciting due to the lack of honey or vanilla which could bring about a bit more creaminess.</p>
      		</div>
      		
      		<div class="fact bigger">
      		  <h3>Bite</h3>
      		  <p>The initial contact with the tongue is fairly weak, no explosion of flavor that you get with a good brew. The bite itself goes just as it comes, quickly and without celebration.</p>
      		</div>
      		
      		<div class="fact bigger">
      		  <h3>After Taste</h3>
      		  <p>The aftertaste feels like a rush of the flavor of the body leaving the mouth quickly, it doesn't really linger or offer anything different than the rest of the drink. A good aftertaste should be enjoyable, the best stuff from the body and bite saying goodbye to your mouth.</p>

	    		  <h3>Body</h3>
	    		  <p>The body is a wonderful combination of delicate flavors. The honey and vanilla work together to bring about a real sweetness within the root spices. I like cane sugar much better than high fructose corn syrup, it has a different mouth feel, but is mostly evidenced in the lack oh a too-heavy aftertaste.</p>
	    		</div>
	    		
	    		<div class="fact bigger">
	    		  <h3>Bite</h3>
	    		  <p>In this brew the carbonation doesn't bite much. There is a significant bite from the spices, however. This excites me.</p>
	    		</div>
	    		
	    		<div class="fact bigger">
	    		  <h3>After Taste</h3>
	    		  <p>The aftertaste is a soft flush of cool flavors. the cool spices and sweet honey and vanilla rest on the tongue for a few pleasurable seconds. a nice clean finish.

    	    		  <p>The aftertaste is where the vanilla really takes center stage. The spice bite fizzes away in the mouth to leave a nice, creamy vanilla aftertaste. A wonderful taste all around however, in this root beer the aftertaste is the most exciting part.</p>

    			  <h3>Body</h3>
    			  <p>Surprisingly, this is a fairly weak bodied brew (maybe because I just reviewed Margo's Bark, which was an excellent full bodied drink.)  the spices are nice and flavorful, but lacks that special something. Positioned as a "root beer float" I would have liked more creaminess and some vanilla.</p>
