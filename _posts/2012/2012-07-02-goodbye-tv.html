  <p>Over the last few years the fervor of my youth has worn down (with some notable exceptions.) So my desire to acquire and live with objects. I no longer need things, or at least I don't need them as much as I used to.</p>

  <p>When I was newly entering into adult hood I took comfort in having. Ownership was a big deal to me, and to be honest, I had the means to own things without acquiring any debt. I bought a house and I furnished it with all the trappings that I considered worthy. Among them was my state-of-the-art (at the time) television, home theater audio system, and video game console. I convinced myself that I needed these things and for a time they made me happy, or at least entertained.</p>
  
  <p>Over time, and as we recently became wanderers, changing residences on average every nine months, my things have become less important to me. One by one Craig's List has claimed them all.</p>
  
  <p>The last of that era, and way of thinking/living, was sold into the hands of another who still cares for having. Behold, the crowning jewel in my shrine to material accumulation is now gone.</p>
  <p>Goodbye television.</p>
</div>

<div class="result copy" style="display:none;">
<p>The selling of the TV was long over due. (I had turned it on about three times in the past ten months anyhow.) The living room that the television occupied was often a lonely place. We hung out in our bedrooms and around the kitchen table mostly. We didn't watch much TV, and there was really no other reason to be in the living room, so it was a relative dead zone.</p>

<p>An amazing thing happened when the TV was sold. The living room came back to life! I discovered that sitting and talking there was a lot more natural without a towering black box in the room. My 2 year old daughter and I started using the reclaimed space to play a game of 'steam rollers'. I cant overstate how much more alive and bright that room became immediately after the removal of its tyrannical overlord, the television.</p>

<p>As for media consumption? I understand that I may be giving the impression that I don't partake at all, but this is not true. I haven't turned on the TV in 10 months because I can find better quality content more easily on my iMac or iPad. With a Hulu or Netflix subscription, it's actually very easy to make your home theater irrelevant. The screens are not as big, and the sounds not as loud — but on the other hand — <em>the screens are not as big, and the sounds not as loud!</em></p>

<p>A blogger I follow once commented that "accessibility trumps ownership, every time." That idea really resonated with me, and I've found it to be true in application. To accompany my TV, sold are my DVD and CD collections.</p>

<p>I am dipping my toe in the idea of replacing my books with digital replicants … but I still need time with that one.</p>
