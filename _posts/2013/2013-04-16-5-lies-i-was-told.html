      <h4>1. Comfort is the goal.</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>This is a pervasive and sinister belief that at times causes us to compromise more than we should. When comfort is the greatest goal we aspire to in life, we refuse anything that may cause pain or hardship. Even if this means we have to abandon the pursuit of our own true-north ethic that we earnestly strive to live by. It is struggle in life that gives it meaning &mdash; the pauses and blessings that punctuate its landscape. The struggle is often against oneself and our own laziness that craves comfort. The creative process is a perpetual assault on the beachhead of apathy. To succumb to comfort, is to turn our backs to the greatness that is on the other side of sacrifice. Refuse the ambition of comfort. This means a daily battle to struggle and fight against the tendency to gravitate toward comfort. The love of comfort is the enemy of greatness.</p>

      <h4>2. Be careful, or you will run out of money.</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>Celebrate having $15 in the bank account at the end of the month. All to often we hold the belief that we are only a few mistakes away from losing everything, and that it is much more important to protect what we have than to focus on what is possible. A scarcity mindset invades every area of life. When we are most concerned with protecting what we have, we loose our ability to recognize opportunities or refuse to act on them because of what could be lost. When the scarcity mindset infiltrates the creative process, it causes us to shrink back to the center and forces us to focus on pragmatics, rather than possibilities. When we do that, we don't venture out into those uncomfortable places. Do not subscribe to the mindset that says "Be careful or you are going to loose everything." Pursue possibility, even in the face of discomfort.</p>

    <h4>3. Everyone else knows something I don't.</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>An "outsider mindset" is something from which no one is immune. Some extremely celebrated business leaders and entertainers have shared their insecurities about whether or not they are really liked and whether or not they are really competent, which is eye-opening to realize. Some of the most successful people in the world feel incompetent or feel like everyone else has something figured out that they don't. In reality, everyone, no matter how confident they appear, is kind of making it up as they go, at least a little. People who thrive are people who are able to get past this fear and to fully engage in the work in front of them.</p>

    <h4>4. You are your work.</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>As creative people, so much of what we make is a result of our intuitions, influences and preferences. As a result, our work is highly personal, as it should be. But at the same time there is a subtle switch thrown that causes us to believe that who we are goes only as far as the latest work we've done or the title we hold. We are not our work and we are especially not defined by how our work is received. This is not an excuse for laziness. This is permission to engage fully and freely, to bless everyone we encounter without worrying about what they think of us. This is hard medicine to swallow in a world that celebrates title and the little spaces we carve out for ourselves in the market place. We need not be defined by the fear of how people respond to what we make. Instead, we can put ourselves fully into our work, knowing that some people are going to like it and others are not, but that it alone will not define who we are as an individual.</p>

    <h4>5. It will never be this good again.</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Fear of the unknown causes us to grasp tightly onto what we can see, touch and smell. We are afraid that risk will result in loosing what we have, and that our future state will never be as good as it is now. So when we refuse to risk and go outside of ourselves, the world becomes a set of smaller and smaller concentric circles that eventually close in on us. We can choose not to care if it is ever "this good" again, and free ourselves from the paralyzing fear of loss aversion. When we are intentional about our lives we can be free to make bold moves and elevate ourselves beyond our current station. Understanding that safety is an illusion can be a liberating knowledge.</p>

    <h4>Concepts, Credits &amp; Closing</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>I sometimes daydream about telling my children certain things, when they are ready to receive them. Things about life, about the world and about purpose and how to make the most of yourself.</p>
    
    <p>This post is a first step in that conversation. I hope my small children read this one day, and are inspired to be more, to be better. I wish someone told me about these things when I was young and starting to make my way in the world. Even now, I need this as a reminder.</p>
    
    <p>This post in an internalization of the words &amp; concepts of Todd Henry on his incredible podcast <a href="http://www.accidentalcreative.com/podcasts/ac/ac-podcast-lies-lies-lies-yeah">The Accidental Creative</a>. Please visit his site and be inspired.</p>
