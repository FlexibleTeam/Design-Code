  <p class="tn">Hey John, Thanks for agreeing to take this interview with me.</p>
  
  <p class="tn">Let's start off slowly, get to know you. Can you describe yourself and your personal history in three statements?</p>
  
  <p>I'm like a 5 year old in a Mc'Donald's playpen. There's a million activities I want to be the best at. I want to be the best at taking pictures of strangers on the street, I want to be the best at building robots, I want to have the coolest area in the office filled with the most interesting things I've seen.</p>

  
  
  <p class="tn sep">Having known and worked on a few projects with you, I know that your drive is something not feigned, yet altogether unique about you.</p> 
  
  <p class="tn">Your photography blog hellasoon.com, is filled with strikingly candid street photos. How did you get into photography as a whole, and then find this really interesting niche of street photography?</p>
  
  <p>I spent my teenage years in Yuba City at a continuation school. This was so I could work a part time job in addition to graduating early. There's nothing to do in Yuba City.</p>
  
  <p>Eventually the boredom was sucking the life out of me and I bought a camera at Sears that turned out of be a piece of sh-t. I returned it and received a better quality camera from my grandmother for my birthday. Holy sh-t! This is awesome. I would spend all of my free time driving around through Browns Valley, Grass Valley, Sutter and Colusa looking for cool stuff to shoot.</p>

  <p class="gallery-title">Early Photos (<span class="counter">1</span> of 5)</p>
  
  <p>I used my family for models. Hell, I have a bazillion brothers and sisters and they don't have anything to do. My brother Sam and I would go trespassing and I'd make him do insane stuff. Often times I would include him in my designs.</p>
  
  <p><img src="/assets/post-assets/045-jon-haggard/img/gtfo.jpg"></p>
  
  <p>This is a poster making fun of the paparazzi and how they would stalk and photograph ghosts. But really it's just Sam in a bed sheet.</p>
  
  <p class="pull-quote">She got breast cancer and I started my first photo series.</p>
  
  <p>I'd bring my camera to family get-togethers and take pictures of everyone when they weren't paying attention. A photo of my mom flexing her iron fist directing one of her 12 kids around a room as we're preparing to open all of our presents on Christmas, and things of that nature.</p>
  
  <p>She got breast cancer and I started my first photo series. As my whole family is a bunch of smart-asses, I named the project One Left Boob.</p>

  <p class="gallery-title">One Left Boob (<span class="counter">1</span> of 8)</p>
  
  <p>Eventually I shot my sister's wedding and swore off photography for 4 years while I spent time honing my design skills in San Francisco.</p>
  






  
  <p class="tn sep">When you left for San Francisco, did you make a clean break from photography? How did graphic design come into the mix? I'm assuming you dabbled on a computer before leaving Yubba City?</p>
  
  <p>I spent my teenage years locked in a shed in my mom's back yard designing Trillian and Winamp skins. I made some really bizzarre designs and got internet famous for always putting out new strange stuff. This was about 2006-2008 when digital design was about how far you can push blending options in photoshop.</p>

  <p class="gallery-title">Trillian &amp; Winamp Skins (<span class="counter">1</span> of 9)</p>
  
  <p>While I made things that people could use I felt like I was in a rut. In addition, I was never able to impress girls by saying that I made media player skins. Having studied and played music as an child I applied my love of lyrics to design.</p>

  <p class="gallery-title">A few posters (<span class="counter">1</span> of 4)</p>
  
  <p>At first I copied my style from Scott Hansen (ISO50), but as I grew I wanted to express different ideas. Russian and American propaganda posters consumed my life and I shifted my focus to creating a story on a piece of paper rather than laying out lyrics.</p>

  <p class="gallery-title">Moar posters (<span class="counter">1</span> of 20)</p>
  
  <p>It was an obsession. I would spend my hours working retail coming up with new ideas for posters, new topics to try and get under the viewer's skin. Pouring through books, scratching ideas down on paper any way I could. Nearly every day I would run to Kinkos and print out a new poster that I had designed the previous night.</p>
  




  
  <p class="tn sep">These are amazing Jon. And you can see a lot of the influence of the trends of the time in a lot of these. When I look at the work you do today, it seems to be a little bit more in front of things, a bit more progressive, pushing boundaries. In content as well as style.</p>
  
  <p class="tn">What do you do to remain fresh? 
  What is inspiring you lately?</p>
  
  <p class="tn">Do you pay attention to what the majority of your peers are doing?
  Is there anything that is in the spotlight right now that turns you off?</p>
  
  <p>I am really horrible about this. I am not part of the design community, or the photography community. I post my stuff on my personal blog and have a small fan base. Communities are great for growth and getting feedback on your work, but I think the discussion usually goes to critisizing the technical aspect of the work and ignores the concept behind the piece.</p>
  
  <p class="pull-quote">I shifted my focus to creating a story</p>
  
  <p>If you look at a photographer's community like 500px.com, most of the shots are flowers, landscapes and portraits of girls in the forrest. Cool. If you want to shoot that type of subject matter in that specific style you can but why not think of something even weirder?</p>
  
  <img style="max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto 20px; display: inherit;" src="/assets/post-assets/045-jon-haggard/img/flower.jpg">
  
  <p>I'd rather build a relationship with the viewer. Get feedback from people who have seen the extent of the work rather than the casual viewer who is commenting just so that you'll look at their page.</p> 
  





  
  <p class="tn sep">Can you talk a little about what you do to stay fresh? what inspires you lately?</p>
  
  <p>I constantly look at my own images and my own work. I know when I see the output exactly what I would improve. If it's a matter of adjusting the design or doing the long work of finding a new model for a series that isn't quite working out. I train my sense of finding what's out of place in a scene and how to fix it to better tell the story. This bleeds into how I take pictures of strangers on the streets. I see what's happening. I see them struggling to put their jacket on. I see the dad laughing with his kid. I see the girl at 2AM falling into her own piss. I take pictures of all of these things.</p>
  
  <p class="pull-quote">I'd rather build a relationship with the viewer</p>
  
  <p>Bettering my relationship with people, and meeting new personalities has informed my decision making in an incredible and intimate way. There are a finite number of people in the world. The more you individuals meet the better sense of how the world works you can get. I hang with everyone. I'm not choosy in the people I talk to. I've shot guns with coke-nailed long hairs in Vietnam</p>
  
  <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/assets/post-assets/045-jon-haggard/img/finger.jpg">
  
  <p>I've stopped beautiful women in the street just to compliment them and take their photo.</p>
  
  <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/assets/post-assets/045-jon-haggard/img/sutter.jpg">
  
  <p>I've gone into a cave at midnight during a thunderstorm with a friend only to find a pervert at the end of the cave who wanted to pose nude for a photo.</p>
  
  <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/assets/post-assets/045-jon-haggard/img/dood.jpg">
  
  <p>Building stories and meeting people is what will helps me understand the world, and that's inspiring.</p>
  





  
  <p class="tn sep">It's awesome to hear you talk about this stuff. I've followed you for a number of years and I am still impressed by the large body of work behind you. It seems like you never stop.</p>
  
  <p class="tn">I've been thinking a lot lately about the creative triggers I place in my own life to make sure I do my best work, to make sure I bring out the value that is buried inside of me. What is your creation ritual? Do you think having one is important?</p>
  
  <p>My thought process is usually something like this.</p>
  
  <p>Oh no! I haven't made anything today, it's already 3 PM. I'm a horrible artist, and nothing I make is cool. Why can't I make cool stuff? Why haven't I made anything cool today? Dude it's 3:01 now, get your sh-t together. Let's hit the ideas list.</p>
  
  <p>No, no, no, that one is dumb, maybe, no, no, not even close. Alright, I can work on my family project and feel good about that. Actually I might go to the docks and see if anything has changed since the last time I've been there.  I don't want to go alone. Can someone drive me? No, Yesenia's busy working on her portfolio. I wonder what Melinda is doing. If she comes over we can take pics of stuff inside of my apartment, and then we'll both have a new project to publish. What do I have in my apartment? What's cheap to buy? I have pink foamcore and a few lights. I guess hotdogs are cheap to buy. I'll invite Melinda over and by the time she gets here I'll already be back from Target with a pack of hotdogs.</p>
  
  <p class="pull-quote">If you want to be happy, do things to make yourself happy.</p>
  
  <p>Lots of laughs later we have a series of images that look awesome and have a funny little story built into them. </p>
    
  <img style="max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto 20px; display: inherit;" src="/assets/post-assets/045-jon-haggard/img/dog.jpg">
  
  <p>The creative trigger for me is to be able to sleep soundly at night knowing that I've made at least 1 thing.</p>
  
  <p class="tn sep">I really like that workhorse approach to creating. It appeals to me in the same way I would sometimes catch my dad leaving to work at the factory at 3am. There is a realness about it.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p class="tn sep">It's interesting to hear that your process involves a lot of doubt and confusion. I think these things are inherent to any creative endeavor. Creativity is often about assembling meaning from seemingly unrelated things, and it takes a few approaches to find the one you want to follow through with.</p>
  
  <p class="tn">Do you have any projects lined up for the future that you are particularly excited about?</p>
  
  <p>My interviewer, Travis, and I are both working on <a href="http://darozadynasty.com/">darozadynasty.com</a> together which is time well spent documenting my family.</p>
  
  <p>It's a modern day family genealogy, an accurate reflection of an abnormal Californian family, their story told by the struggles and triumphs that defined them and reflections of their worlds.</p>

  <p>I'm also building a shrine to the one true god: Nicholas Cage</p>



  
  <p class="tn sep">Thats some awesome stuff. Darozadynasty.com is such a strong project, when I saw it I was the one asking you if I could build it for you. It's so beautiful, I wanted to be a part of it, just to say I was involved in it.</p>
  
  <p class="tn">Let's gear shift a little bit and talk about the bigger of picture. Is there anything you have learned about life lately that has surprised you?</p>
  
  <p>This last one is hard dude, let me think on it for the rest of the day</p>
  
  <p>If you want to be happy, do things to make yourself happy.</p>
