      <h1>30 Year Play List</h1>
      <p>As I turned thirty I searched for a way to review the life that I have lived up to that point. I wanted to understand who I was, where I came from, and why I became who I am now. To aid the meditation I compiled a playlist of the songs that made the biggest impressions on me over the years.</p>
      <p> Music has a way of not just bringing pictures to the theatre of your mind but bringing you places emotionally. This is the soundtrack to my life so far. Please enjoy it, and let me share the accompanying experiences that make these songs so important to me.</p>

          MJ's 'Bad' was a big album. Not just for Michael, not just for the world &mdash; but for me, as a personality. At the age of six, I didn't know a bigger Michael Jackson fan. A fact that was exploited by my deadbeat father when he would make me cassette mix tapes and buy me a copy of Moonwalker on VHS to make up for him being gone for days at a time. Whatever, I could kinda moonwalk and stand on my tippy toes real good.

        When you are this young you don't know much. Your world is only as big as the world your parents let you see. I really loved music, but at this time my Mom only listened to KFM&nbsp;102.5 the country music station. Now, I actaully still like this song, and I listened to it so many times I can recite it from memory. Hell, I guess there is a sliver of cowboy in my heart. My Grandpa had a horse.

          My older brother had a compilation cassette called "Heavy Metal Vol.4" I would steal it and listen to it in my boom box, very quietly so no one would hear it. Then I started stealing his walkman also, so I could listen to it loud! I noticed that if I squeezed the headphones hard against my ears it got even louder! Nice. In my 4th grade notebook I outlined a cool music video for the song, and I would replay it in my mind as we lined up at recess after the bell rang.

        One year my older brother got a stereo unit for christmas. It had a compact disk player in it! It was the coolest thing I had ever seen. He also got this Neal Young CD. So cool. Neal Young was my first live show. It was just like I was there. He would talk to the crowd on the recording and I would imagine I was there. This track was my favorite, so rock and roll. "My my, hey hey, rock and roll is here to stay." Those were lyrics I could get behind.

            The summer leading into middle school was transformative for me. Both my parents were working full time, so we children watched ourselves most of the time. Thinking back, it blows my mind that no one died. That summer I watched more MTV than I care to admit. It had already reached its peak the year before, but that doesn't mean that I didn't see and rock out to this Nirvana jam more than once a day. This was the first time I started associating music preference with a look and a 'type' of person. In 6th and 7th grade I wanted to be fashionably grunge, but I was never more than a dork.

            The very first CD I ever bought with my own hard earned money was Frogstomp. The start of my collection. Back then I had the luxury of having more time with my music, I would listen to the albums over and over again, studying the liner notes and memorizing the lyrics. I think my connection with music was a lot more personal and profound back then. Now it's just whatever someone tells me about or I find on spotify. That tangible relationship is gone. I have heard that vinyl is making a comeback as a response of the iTunes generation. That makes sense. We used to love music, now we just listen to it.

            Middle school is hard, it's all about finding out who you are and where you fit in. So you look for people who have anything in common with you and you exaggerate those qualities in an effort to make these same people like you more. What a cool song. It was the biggest punk song of the time, and allowed me to establish comonalities with a few people at school.

            For a kid who loved punk rock and the DIY scene, I was blown away by how raw and earnest these east coast hip hoppers were. It really took me to another place, mentally and emotionally. This was the fist rap album that I memorized. I would hide my diskman in my back pack and run a headphone up through my sleeve so that I could seemingly rest my head in my hand in class, but really vibe out to the Wu.

            I saw Curl Up And Die preform at the Huntridge Theater for the first time. I was shocked by the savagery and brutality of this local hardcore metal band. They were one of the biggest inspirations for me as I built my own band, and wrote and preformed my own songs. In my adolescent view, these kids were my heroes. We became friends and played shows together. They went on to sign with bigger labels and do large tours, but I'll never forget screaming into the mic like I was going insane at their shows.

            After years of being the lead singer in a hardcore metal band, I turned my attention to the softer side of indie music and really fell in love with the earlier Dashboard stuff. I remember the time I saw him play in a small coffee show just after his first record came out. It was such an intimate setting and I really enjoyed myself. It was around this time that I first started paying attention to girls. Hand in hand with that awareness comes the heartache and turmoil that often comes when teenagers examine their emotions.

            As I prepared to exit my teenage years there was a dramatic shift in the way that I understood the world. A lot of the new insights were internal, focused mostly on the way that I personally interacted with the world around me. There was a shift in the way that I felt about myself and what I wanted to be, and what I felt was the best way to become that person. This song is about change, about waiting and looking for the opportunity to enact that change. It goes a long way to personify the way I felt about living with myself around that time.

            Cave In came to me at a time when I was examining the darkness in my heart and showed me that it is possible to turn form that, and be a brighter more beautiful person, yet maintain that essential self. Cave In was a hardcore metal band that switched suddenly and drastically to an entirely different genera. Same lineup, same name, same label. Just a new position, a new posture.

            Waxwing front man Rocky Votolato has always pricked my soul with his lyrics, and this song is no different. At a time in my life when I was questioning the ideas that I had based my life on for so long, namely the punk rock ethos, this song really struck me. Who are my prophets? What do I believe? Is it okay not to have the answers? I also contacted Waxwing and offered to redesign their website. That was fun. They gave me a bunch of signed merch in return for making them an awesome (by yester-years standards) site.

            When I went to England to serve as a missionary for my church, we didn't really listen to pop music, just churchy stuff. One day I was teaching a guy about Jesus and I noticed a Tom Waits album in his CD collection. I mentioned it, and he enthusiastically put it in for me. After about 20 seconds of listening he yells "This is crap! You can have it!" With that he took it out and threw it at me. I really loved this album in particular because it really portrayed the romantic hobo lifestyle that has always been very attractive to me. Though I never went down that path, I live vicariously through Tom Waits.

            I had been a Rocky fan for years now, since before his solo career, when he fronted Waxwing. But this is that album as a whole was so pivotal to me, so private and sincere. It spoke to me in so many ways. One night, feeling inspired, I grabbed my guitar and figured out a few chords to this song, and I sang the song aloud on the balcony of the apartment I lived in, in Sacramento. I thought I did a good job. The next morning I got a call from the apartment manager. A neighbor had complained that I was playing the guitar and encouraging a dog to bark and howl. Shame, I know thee.

            A lot can be said about John Mayer, mostly by women, but the man is a damn fine guitar player, and an even better lyricists. During my time in Sacramento, I was looking for a new way to be myself. I had spent two years being completely selfless and in doing so had lost a lot of context about now to be normal, and make movements to create the person I was going to be as I transitioned into adulthood.

            This was around the first time I started taking seriously the mating phenomenon. I took it very seriously. After I returned from Sacramento to Las Vegas I met Jayna, who is now my wife and she had(has) this hold on me. A mind blowing attraction. This song speaks to that in a few ways. She and I both bought this CD, but when I saw it in her collection, I thought she stole it from me, which just made her cooler. We attended some awesome concerts together during our courtship, more than one time being Jimmy Eat World. I would listen to this song driving home from her house at 3AM after our ferocious make out session that often lasted hours. This song being a perfect soundtrack for those drives.

            As mentioned in a previous song's note, Jayna and I had epic make out sessions during our courtship. I want my kids to know how awesome we made out. But at the same time, they must never know. Anyhow, this song is the first on the CD that was literally the soundtrack to so much making-out it should be banned. Or at least have a parental warning on the cover of the album. WARNING: YOUR KIDS WILL MAKE OUT, HARD!

            There is a point where the songs in your playlist are no longer your own, but shared with another. Through this they become more meaningful and expressive. Jayna and I saw our story so much in this sweet song that we danced to it at our wedding. We held our hands tighter as it came on the radio. We started into each others eyes and whispered amongst ourselves: "Yes, it is better when we're together."

            Shortly after I married my makeout princess, her mother got married. It was a pleasant affair in Las Angeles. The highlight of the night was making up dances in the car as we drove around all night looking for the hotel, and once we got inside out room still bumping this jam, playing a version of the childhood game "hot lava monster" called "pee pee leapee." I'm pretty good at it.

            If there is a prize for the band I've seen preform live the most, it would go to Thrice. They came to Vegas and we actually played with them, that was the first time I heard them. The thing is, they keep getting better and better. As the years go on I still look forward to Thrice's new releases, as they are always pushing the bounds of how they are personally defined. This record makes the play list because of sheer numbers played.

            When we were dating Jayna introduced me to the magnificent musical Moulin Rouge. It wasn't long before we learned the parts to this duet and sang it lovingly, playfully and powerfully into each others faces! It's that good if you mean it. There is a moment when the song writers words become not just an artistic artifact, but your own sentiment and expression. And besides, it's fun.

            The summer we got the news that Jayna was pregnant again was a ray of sunshine after a "long cold lonely winter." We had lost our first pregnancy and this little bit of good news that became our daughter Parker was a welcome blessing. This song was a theme for our sorrows and joys both.

            In the O.R. my daughters cries reached my ears for the first time. They were such a sweet song. In the nursery, moments later, another song is heard. The lyrics and tune are intended to be romantic. But to me that light ukulele strum was about us. The lyrics "hey, soul sister" were about my daughter. The moment I met her, met her soul. Father to daughter. Brother to sister. I love her.

            For most of this year I worked in downtown oakland. So I had to listen to a lot of rap music, it comes with the territory. I had a bootleg version of this album that I thought was legit. It was really weird, the songs were mostly normal, but sometimes just a little crazy. For example one of the songs, this one, played through normally, but had on top of it that sound you get when your equipment is too close to a magnet. I thought to myself "Kanye is a mad genius that he would do that intentionally!" My friend pointed out that I am retarded and just had a messed up file. Haha, I still like the other one better.

            Parker and I share this one. We would go into her room and walk slowly in a circle during the "nice and quiet" parts, and then really go nuts during the "I like to go crazy!" parts. This is the sound of a man getting on his daughters level, and sharing her world with her. We had a ton of fun dancing, we still do. Currently we dance to Gangnam Style.

            HOLY CRAP, WTF IS HAPPENING? That's what I sounded like when I first heard Skrillex. It was a YouTube video and I watched it on repeat all day long. You can do some angry dance moves to this stuff, right up my alley. This song is not really attached to a specific memory like so many of these tracks are, but I'm old now and music is a lot more disposable than it was when I was a kid.

            I listened to this album for a month straight. Its great to just vibe out to and work all day. This specific song was pumping through the radio in the first few moments of my Sons life. It doesn't resonate the way "Hey, Soul Sister" did with me when my first child was born, but its cool for him to come out of the womb to such a sweet jam.

            In 2012 I took my first trip to NY, a city that I've always wanted to visit. I hit it pretty hard, and wrote a <a href="http://www.travisneilson.com/nyc/">blog post</a> about what I did. If there was a soundtrack to that trip it would be Some Nights by Fun. The memory of walking around Brooklyn with these cheerful, yet driving melodies in my head is a pleasent one. Every time I hear this album it takes me back.

      <p>I hope you enjoyed this autobiography of sorts. It was quite revealing
      to me while putting it together. Some years were filled with more
      meaningful music than others. Some songs were impactful on the course
      of my life, while others simply got a lot of playtime.</p>
      
      <p>Whatever their role, these songs shaped and described who I was and
      how I felt at different times in my life. They are special to me, each
      in their own way.</p>
      
      <p>I've created a <a target="_blank" href="http://open.spotify.com/user/1230301967/playlist/7KQqBiPcMdVvEl84jL39i3">public playlist</a> on spotify for your repeat enjoyment.
      In a way, as you get to know these songs, you get to know me.</p>
