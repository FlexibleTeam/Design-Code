<h2>Workflow Tools</h2>


<section class="intro">The other day I got a letter from a fan of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> asking me about my development setup. I hurriedly shot a list of configurations, apps and such back to him and forgot about it. Later on, he sent me another note thanking me and suggesting I put the list up on my blog as he was sure others could benefit from it also. That sounded reasonable to me, so I expanded the list, found a picture of a bunny and published it on my blog. Now, we wait.</section>


<section>
<h3>Ideation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://mindnode.com/">Mind Node</a>
    <p>This is an awesome way to think visually, especially when mapping out complicated relational scructures, like web app flows and user stories.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_dotPad.shtml">A sketchbook</a>
    <p>For any thinker this is an old standby, I have tons of em. I think there are three in my backpack right now. The best way to quickly capture and iterate through ideas, great for explaining things to people, letting them explain things to you, and more! I have a tendency to use notebooks as mousepads.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Organization</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://trello.com">Trello</a>
    <p>If I could only recomend one tool or app to anyone it would be Trello. If you use this, it will change your life. No joke. This is an organizational tool for your collaborators, your projects, your goals, your life. Organize everything. Srsly bro.</p>  
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://learn.googleapps.com/calendar">Google Calendar / iCal</a>
    <p>Although Trello does have a calendar of sorts, it's more focused around due dates as opposed to making appointments with people, so it can be pretty helpful to have fluency with sheduling apps.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
    <p>Do you like your things? Now you can have your things. Everywhere. I know Dropbox is not the cheapest solution out there, but the workflow, stability and compatability are off the charts. I have a free account and have been working for a while to get extra space here and there. My account is up to 26GB (it starts at 2 :)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>
    <p>I use invision at work, and when I do projects with other people where we need to keep track of ui changes overtime and collaborate on iterations.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>
    <p>We use github at work to collaborate on all our code. I use it to host this blog, and I also use it to host code samples from my YouTube channel DevTips. You should subscribe to that.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://layervault.com">LayerVault</a>
    <p>Think: github for creative files. I really like that becuase my files are version-controlled, I can delete things freely, and If I liked an old idea I just go back in my versions and find it. As opposed to hiding a layer becuase I dont want to follow that idea, but I don't want to throw it away. It just gives me a lot more confidence, and smaller file sizes.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://learn.googleapps.com/gmail">Gmail</a>
    <p>I use the web interface for gmail. I don't use the Apple Mail app on my computer, it's always problematic and you end up with tons of diskspace eaten up by attachments. Gmail has gotten so good (a pretty) that it's preferable to a native app. Compound those reasons with the fact that it is pretty tightly wound with google calendars, docs and hangouts ... well, you got a winner.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a>
    <p>A video chat application that is intertwined with your email, text-chat, and you can make YouTube videos directly with it. Did I mention the iPhone app is awesome? Such Google, very video chat, wow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a>
    <p>Yes, I use photoshop. No, I don't believe it's the only solution. But I also think that people who skip a graphic program and go straight to the browser everytime are a bit premature. Designing in code is not as flexible as photoshop, not yet. And you can tell by looking at them if the site was designed in the browser. I have opinions on the topic, but the funny thing is this article was created in the browser. But let's be honest: it shows, doesn't it?</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a>
    <p>I like Illustrator. I'm kinda gnarly with a pen tool. I think I could drop old Illy, but since its part of the Adobe CC, why not? I use it here and there. Mostly for icons and junk, logos, whatever.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://xscopeapp.com/">Xscope</a>
    <p>I think this is a great tool for anyone making websites. Especially engineery types who dont want to open photoshop when they get mockups from a designery person. With Xscope you can take quick measurements, set up guides that run across your screen, and sample colors like woah. It's really great. Whenever I show it to developers their eyes light up!</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/">Keynote</a>
    <p>Keynote is awesome, and the new update is easier than ever to use. (Let me hear you say centered artboard! woot!) I use it all the time to comunicate ideas. If I want to tell my boss what I'm trying to accomplish, just make a three slide keynote. Easy! Businessy-types get all excited when you show them a slideshow, haha. I also use Keynotes awesome animation engine to make little movies that I include in my YouTube videos all the time. It's really super duper!</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://bohemiancoding.tumblr.com/post/65603011680/retiring-fontcase">FontCase</a>
    <p>Before he made the graphics app Sketch, the guy from Boheniam Coding made FontCase. I really like it as a way to organize and search my fonts for a project. I love that you can specify a font library location, making it possible to put your font library in Dropbox, allowing you to take your fonts everywhere you go! [Edit: looks like they removed this app, oops!]</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/introducing-loremify/">Loremify</a>
    <p>When you need some Lorem quickly this dasboard widget has your back.</p>
  </li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Dev Apps</h3>
<ul>
  
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="">my phone/tablet/browser</a>
    <p>Creating responsive web experiences requires the right tools. I'm switching from device to device often to make sure my vision holds up across them all.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/" target="_blank">Espresso</a>
    <p>Espresso is my code editor of choice. It may be a little too non-nerdy for a lot of other developers. But I've tried atom and sublime and coda and a few others and I keep coming back to Espresso.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">MAMP</a>
    <p>Great for when I'm working on a project that needs an apache server and a local database, like Wordpress. Super simple and powerful. Love it.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/10-terminal-commands-that-every-mac-user-should-know--mac-4825" target="_blank">Terminal</a>
    <p>I'm just learning, and I'm still quite clumsy in Terminal, but It's super important to new workflows, so I'm forcing myself.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a>
    <p>The best way to write CSS. I love it.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_blank">CodeKit</a>
    <p>Sometimes I use codekit to compile my sass, and other things, but not all the time, and less and less as I get better in the terminal. It has the best livereload feature I've used.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://bourbon.io/" target="_blank">Bourbon</a>
    <p>Bourbon is a super awesome and lightweight SASS Mixin library that does a ton of cool and handy stuff.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>
    <p>I've never written javascript without using jQuery in some way. It's essential for me.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>
    <p>Wordpress is my CMS of choice for people who need a CMS. It's really great software, and its so ubiqutious that you can count on most clients to have some degree of familiarity with it.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>
    <p>Jekyll is my new website CMS of choice. It is awesome for a lot of reasons. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KQZUkRjfwMmTq_f1fbxerI">I made a video about it.</a></p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/" target="_blank">Tower</a>
      <p>I don't love tower, but it does what it does pretty well. It's a GUI for git, which I need at this point. I'll phase this out as I get better with Terminal, but I still need it now.</p>
    </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>
    <p>I like Chrome, but I prefer Safari. The problem is that the lastest version of Safari ruined the dev tools, so it's kind of unusable for me.</p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="http://livereload.com/" target="_blank">Live Reload</a>
    <p>I use livereload right now in a kinda hacky way. It's supposed to auto refresh your browser as you work, but I'm still working out the kinks in my workflow. Sometimes I don't use it as it can be more hasle then it's worth...</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/" target="_blank">SizeUp</a>
    <p>Prescicely place your app windows with keyboard shortcuts. be sure to add the free <a href="https://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/labs/" target="_blank">ShadowSweeper</a> from the same developer to remove all OSX dropshadows so youe windows sit nicely edge to edge. Cant dev w/o both.</p>

<h3>Web Services</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google.com</a>
    <p>Just bing it, bro.</p>  
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-match/" target="_blank">iTunes Match</a>
    <p>I tried a lot of the music solutions popular today; Spotify, Rdio, others. But Itunes Match has it. I like listening to full albums, I like the album collection I've built over the years, transfering all those punk rock demo tapes from my teens was a pain in a butt, and I love them. Also iTunes radio. It's nice.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.readability.com/" target="_blank">Readability</a>
    <p>One of the hardest things about information overload is deciding what you will give your attention to. I have too much to do to listen to everyone and read everything, so I am selective of what I allow into my read list. I lke that its not a feed, like feedly where others are putting things there just by publishing. Generally, if I put it in my readability, I'm going to read it.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://feedly.com" target="_blank">Feedly</a>
    <p>Often how things get to my readability reading list. This is useful for keeping tabs on people who I know constantly product great reading content.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck" target="_blank">TweetDeck</a>
    <p>I follow 3 people on twitter. If you tweet interesting things I put you in a list on twitter and then track that list on tweetdeck. Srsly. No other way to do the twitter.</p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
    <p>YouTube is like crack for me. I can learn anything. I also produce a weekly YouTube Show called <a target="_blank" href="http://youtube.com/devtipsfordesigners">DevTips</a> where I teach people how to do the codes.</p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="http://usepanda.com/" target="_blank">Panda</a>
    <p>Panda is my new design new hub. It aggrigates Designer News, Hacker News and Sidebar.io — and also displays popular dribbble and behance projects for some reason.</p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble.com</a>
    <p>I look at dribbble to see how other people solved the same problems. Dribbble also is a pretty great place to find freebies. Need to but your design in an iPhone render for a mockup? There are like 1 billion of them here.</p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="www.behance.net" target="_blank">Behance.com</a>
    <p>Behance is a more serious/professional place when it comes to showcasing your work. I feel like most of the work inquiries I get are from behance.</p>
  </li>
    
  <li>
    <a href="www.meetup.com" target="_blank">Meetup.com</a>
    <p>I like meeting up. I often bring my camera to meetups and <a href="http://youtu.be/tnxMTUFy0KA" target="_blank">ask people questions</a>.</p>
  </li>
    
    
  <li>
    <a href="http://pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>
    <p>Not just for girls anymore. A great source for keeping your thumb on the latest trends in UI Design.</p>
  </li>
    
  
    
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.noisli.com/" target="_blank">Noisli</a>
    <p>It's a background noise web app. I'm using it right now. You can mix soundscapes, so I tend to listen to coffeshop chatter in the forrest with birds chirping in the rain. Try it.</p>

<h3>Podcasts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast" target="_blank">This American Life</a>
    <p>I listen to Design-centered podcasts and I listen to anthropologically themed podcasts. This one may be the most obvious podcast ever, but I really like it because it helps me to step outside of myself and hopefully gain a bit of empathy for others.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <a href="http://youmadeitweird.libsyn.com/" target="_blank">You Made It Weird</a>
    <p>Another of what I would consider an anthropologically themed podcast. Pete Holmes (Yea, the talk show host) is one of the best interviewers I've ever listened to, and he talks to a wide gammut of people. A lot of other comedians, to be sure, but also a theoretical physicist every now and then.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <a href="http://onthegrid.co/" target="_blank">On the Grid</a>
