	<strong>Eyes</strong>
	<p>She tilted her head and said contemplatively &#8220;Do you think she looks like a Parker?&#8221;</p>
	
	<p>The child&#8217;s head picked up a bit and you could tell that hearing her own name piqued her interest. I looked down at her. Her brown eyes swallowing the room around her. Everything seemed to fall in to her big, beautiful, expressive eyes.</p>
	
	<p>&#8220;Why? don't you think she looks like a Parker?&#8221;</p>
	
	<p>She closed her eyes and shook her head. It was a tight, small shake, kind of like she was shivering. With her eyes still closed for a second, she said &#8220;No, no. That's not what I meant. I just wondered if you thought that.&#8221;</p>
	
	<p>Then I understood why she was acting strangely, she had been swallowed up in the little girls eyes, and was trying to break the trance.</p>
	
	<p>&#8220;The thing about naming something is that after a while, it just <em style="font-family:georgia,serif;">is</em> the thing you name it.&#8221;</p>

	<strong>Not Chicago</strong>
	<p>The lyrics ran their course through her head: &#8220;Remember that time in Chi-icago; I remember you, but not the way that we - go.&#8221; Over and over in her mind a meaningless line about a far away city that she had never been to, a way to calm herself.</p>
	
	<p>Bing! &#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, the Captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign. Please return to your seats.&#8221;</p>
	
	<p>&#8220;Remember that time in Chi-ica—&#8221; A sudden lurch in her stomach let her know that the craft was in a  free fall. White knuckles, she clenches the arm rests and closes her eyes.</p>
	
	<p>&#8220;I remember you, but not the—&#8221; </p>

	<strong>The Train</strong>
		<p>He fumbles past the pneumatic doors as they start to close and crash-lands in the seat next to me. How I love meeting new people on the train. This guy was a doozy, he looked like he was 48 in a 28 year olds body. Like he had lived real hard or something. He had short buzzed hair and lines on his face that seemed like they were carved out with a jagged rock. His overcoat was a heavy canvas material that the rain balled up on, it threw drops of water this way and that with his sharp jerky motions. Heavy boots weighed his feet to the floor and he used concerted effort to shift them about when he moved. And he did move. Just fidgeting the whole time. It's a fourteen minute ride from this stop to the next, we are expressing all the way into the city, the whole time hes moving around and shifting and shooting me glares. I try to be obvious that I want to keep to myself and I hug even closer into the glow of my iPad, My finger rapidly moving over the surface of the screen.</p>
		
		<p>&#8220;You need that don't you? You need the safety of that device to keep you from the realities of what is going on in the real world.&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>He just stares at me. I'm dumbstruck. Does he really want an answer? What do I say to make him leave me alone?</p>
		
		<p>Suddenly he's wrestling with himself again. His spine curls and his head goes low. He wraps his right hand around his left index finger, like he's about to do some magic trick. Then he begins to pull. And I don't mean that he just kinda tugs on it. He starts pulling on his finger like its the end of the world. I am so weirded out at this point.</p> 
		
		<p>&#8220;W-What are yo&mdash;&#8221;</p>
		
		<p>I see the joint beneath his skin kind of, I don't know, look very strange. Then a loud snap! You could totally tell it was broken, this guy just broke his finger in front of me. But he doesn't stop there, he keeps going. He starts twisting it and I start to see his skin rip. I swear it's the most gross and unnatural thing I ever saw. Blood starts squirting everywhere, and with a large jerk the finger comes off.</p>
		
		<p>He looks me straight in the eye, I am freaking out. He holds up the torn and bloody lump of flesh that used to be his finger, an inch or two from my face, and says &#8220;I don't need nothin.&#8221;</p>

	<strong>The Cube</strong>
		<p>Tap - Tap - Tap. The keyboard sung it's unique song as his fingers danced over it. He tried not looking at the cube. The cube. A mere foot from his hand, the cosmic cube. How it came to be — and indeed how he came to be in possession of such a thing — still causes him to question reality.</p>
        <p>Tap - Tap -Tap. But what now? Now that anything was possible, what should be done? Reed paused his typing, rubbed his eyes, and clenched his teeth. The strength it took to resist the pull of the cube was exhausting.</p>
        <p>When he opened his eyes he gasped.</p>
        <p>Oh, No. Even with all the care he had taken to prevent this, yet still it happened. The cube had spoken to him. Spoken through him. And his life would never be the same.</p>
        <p>On the screen was the message, glowing in bright green phosphorus, were the words: "All your base are belong to us."</p>

	<strong>Talking</strong>
	<p>They walk and they talk. The chatter is overheard and ignored by most. The day before this was the same. On the street, in the city it's always the same, they walk by talk, talk, talking about the night before and who did what to whom. Does it really matter? Will the world be any different tomorrow because of it.</p>
	
	<p>We sit on the park bench and watch them walk by, and nothing changes. We wonder to ourselves and out loud that if this person disappeared there would be another body there to fill the void. The faces change over the years, but the voices, the sounds, are still the same. People talking, carrying on like the things they say are important.</p>

	<strong>Tea</strong>

	<p>&#8220;One second, the tea is ready&#8221; she said as she rose from the table. At the pot, she furrowed her brow and poured. Two cups. She returned to the kitchen table, a flat earthy wooden table top with rod iron legs.</p>
	
	<p>&#8220;So, why are you telling my this just now?&#8221; Steeping the tea just the way her mother used to. Nice and slow.</p> 
	
	<p>&#8220;I wasn't ready. It wasn't ready. I mean, something like this doesn't just happen, it's more a series of small happenings. And then, you know, you look at it and realize it’s something. Anyway, I'm telling you now. I haven't told anyone yet. But I'm telling you, you are the first.&#8221;</p>
	
	<p>Still looking at the tea, but unable to drink it, her head still spinning. &#8220;So, who are you?&#8221; She looked up and then he saw it. The fear. She was afraid of him.</p> 
	
	<p>&#8220;What? No, I'm me. I'm the same me that you always knew.&#8221; He said earnestly &#8220;it's not a question of who, it's when.&#8221;</p>

  <strong>Mother</strong>
  <p>The door of the car swung open, or rather creaked open. The build up of rust in the hinges and in the places where the pain had flaked off had led to there being a cacophony of sound.</p>
  
  <p>My Father ducked if head as he crawled into the car. Because the curb was so high, it would be more accurate to say that he fell into the car. The car bounced, the shocks responding to the sudden increase of weight.</p>
  
  <p>I looked at him out the corner of my eye. His face was nearly expressionless. I say nearly because I knew better. I could see, under the facade, I could see his despair and his worry.</p>
  
  <p>&#8220;I ehh, I got this for you.&#8221; He reached into the small brown bag he had brought with him out if the corner store and bulled out a Big Hunk candy bar. He tossed it to me and tousled my hair. 
  Letting a moment slip in to awkwardness, he started again, and said: &#8220;Son, ahem, your... Ah, your mother is dead now.&#8221;</p>
  
  <p>He reached down and put his hand on the key, pausing for a half a second, then started the car.</p>

  <strong>The Quiet Place</strong>
  
  <p>Okun’s heart raced. Beads of sweat gathered at his temples. The air was warm and alive. Night creatures began to slither and scatter around him. The golden sun had just fallen behind the rocky mountain skyline, washing the desert sky in orange and pink. This is Arizona. There is no one around for 300 miles.</p>
  
  <p>&#8220;It's just over this ridge&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;Just a little further now.&#8221;</p>
  
  <p>Okun had been walking for hours. The journey had become untraversable by his jeep miles back, a narrow canyon blocked his vehicle and he had to abandon it. Surely he would not have been able to drive that old jeep along the canyon shelf he now carefully made his way across.</p>
  
  <p>He had heard an old folk legend about the dead place, a place the natives were afraid to go. He had spent months preparing and researching. Why has no one tried to discover the secret of the quiet place?</p>
  
  <p>As Okun made his way over up and over the last shelf the air cooled and became still. Pulling himself up onto the last ledge of this rocky formation Okun noticed that the crickets were no longer chirping and the snakes were no longer slithering about. All of the desert creatures seemed to stop and watch, to be still. To be quiet.</p>
  
  <p>Okun stood there, at the edge of the cliff face. The feeling was unlike anything he'd ever felt. As if he'd climbed through an invisible barrier, sound simply ceased to exist. Nothing made noise, nothing dared too.</p>
  
  <p>As the warmth of the pink and orange colors faded from the sky and the darkness began to take over, Okun noticed that the ground still retained some of that glow. The gravel and rock and stone seemed to reflect light that was no longer shining on them. The light grew in intensity. The air around Okun became more and more crisp, cold but not cold, dry. And the sound... The lack of sound was deafening. The light emanating from the desert floor was now blinding, Okun had to cover his eyes with his hands to keep what felt like his eyes searing out.</p>
  
  <p>Okun had never experienced anything like this. And no one would ever know.</p>
