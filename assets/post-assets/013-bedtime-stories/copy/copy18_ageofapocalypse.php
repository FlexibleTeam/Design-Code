		<h2 class="comic-title">Age of Apocalypse</h2>
		<p>When I was in seventh grade just about the biggest event in comics was the colossal crossover called The Age Of Apocalypse. All of the X Men books were temporarily renamed and renumbered. The plot was that Professor X was assassinated in his early life. His best friend (Magneto) was deeply effected by his death and took up his vision of a peaceful existence between man and  mutant. An amazing story.</p>

		<p><b>OMG Moment:</b> In the final panels the X Men destroy themselves and North America in order to stop the evil Apocalypse.</p>
