		<h2 class="comic-title">Weapon X No.6</h2>
		
		<p>Once upon a time there was a sanitarium where all the craziest people were sent to get better, or to be forgotten. Logan finds himself lost with the forgotten, trying to remember who he is and believing that he belongs there among the insane, that he is insane. He is forced to take his meds and go to bed on time.</p>

		<p><b>OMG Moment:</b> At the end of the first book the camera pans outside Logans padded cell to a man washing off letters, written in blood, saying: My name is Logan. I am not insane.</p>
