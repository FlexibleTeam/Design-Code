		<h2 class="comic-title">X23: Innocence Lost</h2>
		<p>A secret lab trying to recreate the weapon x project (again) has successfully cloned wolverine (on the 23rd attempt) as a little girl. The little girl, named X23, is rather cute and endearing - So it's crazy when she pops claws and tears people up.</p>

		<p><b>OMG Moment:</b> Poor X23. She is triggered into a berserker state and deceived into killing the only person who cared for her, the woman who carried her in her womb, the woman who, with her last dying breath, gave X23 a name: Laura.</p>
