		<h2 class="comic-title">Wolverine No.67</h2>
		<p>When I was in junior high school I stole a few of my brothers Wolverine comics. They were stunning and threw me into lifetime of Wolverine fandom.</p>

		<p><b>OMG Moment:</b> Wolverine runs around the world, guided by the two imaginary angels sitting on his shoulder (who don't exist) in search of a person named Terry Adams (who doesn't exist.) This is one of those awesome, crazy Wolvie stories from the 90's (that doesn't exist.)</p>
