		<h2 class="comic-title"> Ultimate Spiderman Clone Saga</h2>
		<p>Ultimate spiderman is bar none the best written comic out there. Peter Parker has been cloned ... several times. His clones have shards of his memories and are all in love with MJ. Some try to protect her from harm, others try to inject her with super power serum. Some of Peters clones have robot suits, some have six arms, some are female. Chaos. Fun.</p>

		<p><b>OMG Moment:</b> Gwen Stacy is back from the dead. Wait. Oh, snap. She's Carnage.</p>
