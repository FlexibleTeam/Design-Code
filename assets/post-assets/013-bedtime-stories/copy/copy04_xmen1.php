		<h2 class="comic-title">X Men No.1</h2>
		<p>What is the quintessential comic book from your childhood? For me this is it. The team is perfect, Cyke, Wolvie, Jube, Colosus, Gambit, Rouge et al. Living in Westchester in the mansion, being led by Professor X. Mutants at the top of their game, as opposed to the hunted minority huddled off SF that they are now.</p>

		<p><b>OMG Moment:</b> This is how I like to think of Magneto. Strong, youthful, a perfect blend of idealism, hermitism, and anti-heroism.</p>
