		<h2 class="comic-title">The Galactus Saga</h2>
		
		<p>The ultimate universe is mind blowing. I love it. In the ultimate universe Galactus is a world devouring energy concensiousness called Gah Lak Tus. (as opposed to the big dude with a crazy hat.) Vision was sent and captured by the Russians in the cold war to warn the earth of it's impending doom. An awesome story.</p>
		
		<p><b>OMG Moment:</b> Reed Richards destroys another universe and uses the force of that explosion to divert the Gah Lak Tus. </p>
