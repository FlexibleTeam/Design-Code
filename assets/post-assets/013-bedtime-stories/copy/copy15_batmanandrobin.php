		<h2 class="comic-title">All Star Batman <br />& Robin</h2>
		
		<p>The art is fantastic and the writing portrays Batman as a kind of lunatic. I like that. He runs around in the night jumping from roof top to roof top laughing insanely looking for fights. He breaks bones, uses molotov cocktails, and refers to himself famously as "The God Damn Batman!!" Batman is constantly slapping Robin around and starving him till he eats rats. Robin nearly kills GreenLantern, and the Joker is buff with tats and chokes girls.</p>
