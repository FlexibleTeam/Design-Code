		<h2 class="comic-title">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</h2>
		<p>More like a Saturday morning cartoon meets an arcade game than most of the comics I'm used too. If you saw the movie I'm sorry. If you didn't, don't. Just read this. Scott is a totally clueless antihero, but not annoying like Michael Cera. More adorable and funny &mdash; like Alicia Silverstone. Anyway, Scott fights people and finds change afterward.</p>

		<p><b>OMG Moment:</b> None, it's just fun.</p>
